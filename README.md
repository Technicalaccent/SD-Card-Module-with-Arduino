Micro SD Card Module Pin out

The Micro SD Card module has 6 pins; those are GND, VCC, MISO, MOSI, SCK, and CS. All the pins of this sensor module are digital, except VCC and Ground.
 

-> GND is the ground pin of the micro sd card module and it should be connected to the ground pin of the Arduino.

-> VCC is the power supply pin of the micro sd card module that can be connected to 5V or 3.3V of the supply.

-> MISO Stands for Master In Slave Out. This is the SPI data out from the SD Card Module.

-> MOSI Stands for Master Out Slave In. This is the input pin of the SD Card Module.

-> SCK Stands for Serial Clock as the name implies it is the data synchronization pulse generated by the Arduino.

-> CS Stands for Chip Select, this pin can be controlled by the Arduino to enable or disable the module.
